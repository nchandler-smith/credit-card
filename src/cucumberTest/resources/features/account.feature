Feature: Account Creation
  As a FinTech customer,
  I want a process to create new accounts,
  So that I can issue and assign new credit cards.

  Scenario: Create a cardholder account
    Given a cardholder Name: "Steve Goliath", SSN:"123-45-6789", Merchant: "Target"
    When a request is made to create an account for this cardholder
    Then a new account is created and a new card number is issued to that account and returned
    And a credit limit of 10,000 is assigned
